# make-your-game TO-DO LIST 📋

✔️ Game runs at at least 60 FPS at all times
✔️ No frame drops!
✔️ Proper use of RequestAnimationFrame
✔️ It is very hard to predict performances in JS. So measure performances to see if your code is fast. This will be tested!
- Pause menu, that includes:
    - Continue
    - Restart
    - For the pause menu you must be able to pause, restart, and continue the game whenever you want to do so. The frames should not drop if paused.
- A score board that displays the following metrics:
    ✔️ Countdown clock or Timer that will indicate the amount of time the player has until the game ends or the time that the game has been running
    - Score that will display the current score (XP or points)
    - Lives that shows the number of lives that the player has left
- The use of layers must be minimal but not zero in order to optimize the rendering performance.

✔️ You must not use frameworks or canvas, the game must be implemented using plain JS/DOM and HTML only

✔️ the player must only use the keyboard

✔️ no key spamming: if a key is kept pressed, the player must continue to do the relevant action. If the key is released the player should stop doing the action.

✔️ motions triggered by a key must not jank or stutter.
